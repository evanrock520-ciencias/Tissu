 * @class PinConstraint
 * @brief Implementation of a positional pin constraint using XPBD.

 * Anchors a single particle to a fixed point in world space, preventing it
 * from moving away from the target position. The constraint function is:
 * @f[
 * C(\mathbf{p}) = |\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{p}_{pin}|
 * @f]
 * A compliance of 0.0 produces a perfectly rigid pin. Higher values
 * allow the particle to drift, which can be used to simulate
